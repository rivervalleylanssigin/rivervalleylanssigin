The longer you stretch out an auto loan, the lower the monthly payment will be. Since the full loan amount is spread over a longer period of time, it’s divided into smaller loan payments. There can be positive aspects for both long-term and short-term auto loans.

Choosing a longer auto loan term with lower payments might enable you to buy a more reliable car at a higher price. It could also make it possible to qualify for a car loan that will help you establish or rebuild credit—as long as you make the payments on time.

Also, if you’re in a financial position to afford the higher payments of a shorter-term car loan, and you go that direction, there are benefits. Along with saving on interest costs, paying off the loan in a shorter time frame might give you a break from car payments before taking out another auto loan.
